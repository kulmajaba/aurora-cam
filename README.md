A web-based control UI for a DSLR.

Node backend using gphoto2, React frontend

Important: this is a hacked-together project done in less that 24 hours as a challenge. Don't take this as an example on how to do anything.

Prerequisites:
* Node and npm
* gphoto2
* convert from ImageMagick

Running for development:
* `npm start` to start the React dev server
* `node server.js` to start the Node/gphoto2 backend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
